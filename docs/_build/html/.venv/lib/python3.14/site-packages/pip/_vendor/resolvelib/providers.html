    &quot;&quot;&quot;Given a requirement or candidate, return an identifier for it.

    This is used to identify, e.g. whether two requirements
    should have their specifier parts merged or a candidate matches a
    requirement via ``find_matches()``.

def get_preference(
    self,
    identifier: KT,
    resolutions: Mapping[KT, CT],
    candidates: Mapping[KT, Iterator[CT]],
    information: Mapping[KT, Iterator[RequirementInformation[RT, CT]]],
    backtrack_causes: Sequence[RequirementInformation[RT, CT]],
) -&gt; Preference:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Produce a sort key for given requirement based on preference.

    As this is a sort key it will be called O(n) times per backtrack
    step, where n is the number of `identifier`s, if you have a check
    which is expensive in some sense. E.g. It needs to make O(n) checks
    per call or takes significant wall clock time, consider using
    `narrow_requirement_selection` to filter the `identifier`s, which
    is applied before this sort key is called.

    The preference is defined as &quot;I think this requirement should be
    resolved first&quot;. The lower the return value is, the more preferred
    this group of arguments is.

    :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. This
        identifies the requirement being considered.
    :param resolutions: Mapping of candidates currently pinned by the
        resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value is a candidate.
        The candidate may conflict with requirements from ``information``.
    :param candidates: Mapping of each dependency&#39;s possible candidates.
        Each value is an iterator of candidates.
    :param information: Mapping of requirement information of each package.
        Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*.
    :param backtrack_causes: Sequence of *requirement information* that are
        the requirements that caused the resolver to most recently
        backtrack.

    A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members:

    * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current
      list of candidates.
    * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (depended on) the
      requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement.

    The preference could depend on various issues, including (not
    necessarily in this order):

    * Is this package pinned in the current resolution result?
    * How relaxed is the requirement? Stricter ones should probably be
      worked on first? (I don&#39;t know, actually.)
    * How many possibilities are there to satisfy this requirement? Those
      with few left should likely be worked on first, I guess?
    * Are there any known conflicts for this requirement? We should
      probably work on those with the most known conflicts.

    A sortable value should be returned (this will be used as the ``key``
    parameter of the built-in sorting function). The smaller the value is,
    the more preferred this requirement is (i.e. the sorting function
    is called with ``reverse=False``).
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    raise NotImplementedError

def find_matches(
    self,
    identifier: KT,
    requirements: Mapping[KT, Iterator[RT]],
    incompatibilities: Mapping[KT, Iterator[CT]],
) -&gt; Matches[CT]:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Find all possible candidates that satisfy the given constraints.

    :param identifier: An identifier as returned by ``identify()``. All
        candidates returned by this method should produce the same
        identifier.
    :param requirements: A mapping of requirements that all returned
        candidates must satisfy. Each key is an identifier, and the value
        an iterator of requirements for that dependency.
    :param incompatibilities: A mapping of known incompatibile candidates of
        each dependency. Each key is an identifier, and the value an
        iterator of incompatibilities known to the resolver. All
        incompatibilities *must* be excluded from the return value.

    This should try to get candidates based on the requirements&#39; types.
    For VCS, local, and archive requirements, the one-and-only match is
    returned, and for a &quot;named&quot; requirement, the index(es) should be
    consulted to find concrete candidates for this requirement.

    The return value should produce candidates ordered by preference; the
    most preferred candidate should come first. The return type may be one
    of the following:

    * A callable that returns an iterator that yields candidates.
    * An collection of candidates.
    * An iterable of candidates. This will be consumed immediately into a
      list of candidates.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    raise NotImplementedError

def is_satisfied_by(self, requirement: RT, candidate: CT) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Whether the given requirement can be satisfied by a candidate.

    The candidate is guaranteed to have been generated from the
    requirement.

    A boolean should be returned to indicate whether ``candidate`` is a
    viable solution to the requirement.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    raise NotImplementedError

def get_dependencies(self, candidate: CT) -&gt; Iterable[RT]:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Get dependencies of a candidate.

    This should return a collection of requirements that `candidate`
    specifies as its dependencies.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    raise NotImplementedError

    self,
    identifiers: Iterable[KT],

) -&gt; Iterable[KT]:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    An optional method to narrow the selection of requirements being
    considered during resolution. This method is called O(1) time per
    backtrack step.

    :param identifiers: An iterable of `identifiers` as returned by
        ``identify()``. These identify all requirements currently being
        considered.
    :param resolutions: A mapping of candidates currently pinned by the
        resolver. Each key is an identifier, and the value is a candidate
        that may conflict with requirements from ``information``.
    :param candidates: A mapping of each dependency&#39;s possible candidates.
        Each value is an iterator of candidates.
    :param information: A mapping of requirement information for each package.
        Each value is an iterator of *requirement information*.
    :param backtrack_causes: A sequence of *requirement information* that are
        the requirements causing the resolver to most recently
        backtrack.

    A *requirement information* instance is a named tuple with two members:

    * ``requirement`` specifies a requirement contributing to the current
      list of candidates.
    * ``parent`` specifies the candidate that provides (is depended on for)
      the requirement, or ``None`` to indicate a root requirement.

    Must return a non-empty subset of `identifiers`, with the default
    implementation being to return `identifiers` unchanged. Those `identifiers`
    will then be passed to the sort key `get_preference` to pick the most
    prefered requirement to attempt to pin, unless `narrow_requirement_selection`
    returns only 1 requirement, in which case that will be used without
    calling the sort key `get_preference`.

    This method is designed to be used by the provider to optimize the
    dependency resolution, e.g. if a check cost is O(m) and it can be done
    against all identifiers at once then filtering the requirement selection
    here will cost O(m) but making it part of the sort key in `get_preference`
    will cost O(m*n), where n is the number of `identifiers`.

    Returns:
        Iterable[KT]: A non-empty subset of `identifiers`.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return identifiers
